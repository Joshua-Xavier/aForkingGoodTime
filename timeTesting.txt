firstly running
$ time ./task2 3 abc def ghi
gave an average of real 0m.0.010s

with a slightly longer string
$ time ./task2 3 abc123 def ghijkl
we see an average of 0m.0.014s
However to test this is even a performance boost
we can force the app to run sequentially and see the
difference.
Sequential time = 0m0.019s

The real test will now be to run multiple long strings and see
if we can get a drastic improvement
$ time ./task2 3 abcdefghij 123456789? nopqrstuvw

SEQUENTIAL:
